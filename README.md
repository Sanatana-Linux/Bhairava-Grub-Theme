## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is my repository for my customized Grub2 theme, complete with my original artwork to be utilized as several wallpaper options available to the user at the onset of the installation script provided wuth

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
For most Linux users, this will be a painless install. For those using other boot managers, good luck with them but this is not something likely to work with whatever your bootloader is, as it is meant for grub. 

### Prerequisites
- `dialog` - for the menu
- `git` - to clone the repo
- `grub2`  - where the theme is being applied
**That's it,** nothing else is required. 

### Installing
This requires you first clone the repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/the-Electric-Tantra-Linux/Bhairava-Grub-Theme && cd Bhairava-Grub-Theme
```

Now run the handy installation script and the menu will handle it from there!

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the theme, simply reboot and it should replace the default grub theme for you. 

## Gallery 
Below are the images that are offered as backgrounds you can choose from, this way you have a reference before being prompted to choose at install time.
